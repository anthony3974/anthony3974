# 👋 Hi, I’m Anthony (@anthony3974)

I’m a software developer with a strong interest in **Linux systems, backend development, and applied infrastructure**. I enjoy building full-stack applications, automating systems, and running real services end-to-end rather than working only in isolated demos.

## 🚀 What I Work With
- **C# / .NET** – Building backend services and application logic  
- **Python** – Automation, data pipelines, and system tooling  
- **Linux (Ubuntu)** – Daily use, server management, troubleshooting  
- **REST APIs** – Designing and consuming JSON-based services  
- **SQL / Data Systems** – MySQL, SQL Server, HDFS  
- **Git** – Collaborative workflows, branching, and conflict resolution  

## 🧠 Projects & Interests
- **Systems Monitoring + HDFS Pipeline** – Collected and aggregated system metrics, enforced retention policies, and visualized trends across multiple VMs  
- **AI Price Checker (Capstone)** – UI/UX consistency, client-side auth state management, and performance UX improvements in a team-based project  
- **Home Server** – Proxmox-based environment using OpenMediaVault for storage and Nextcloud as the public interface, accessed privately via Tailscale VPN  

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- Linux systems administration and infrastructure tooling  
- Automation and monitoring for long-running services  
- Backend and platform-adjacent development  

## 💡 Open to Collaborate On
Projects involving **backend development, Linux systems, automation, or infrastructure-adjacent software**.

## ⚡ Fun Fact
I enjoy running and maintaining my own systems just as much as writing the software that runs on them.
